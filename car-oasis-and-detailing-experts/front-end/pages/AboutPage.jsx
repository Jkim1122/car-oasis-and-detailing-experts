                <p>C.O.D.E was initially a friend's business idea and I wanted to create a website that users could use for easy booking.</p>
                <p>Eventually this website will have a lot more user features including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>requesting picture updates of the user's vehicle(s)</li>
                    <li>notifications for when the vehicle's storage reservation is coming to an end</li>
                    <li>a map of the storage facility & showing reserved and open parking spaces</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </>
